Put your icon file here as: `app_icon.png` (PNG, square, recommended 1024x1024 or 512x512).

You provided an image in the chat. To install it into the project:

1. Save the provided image to `assets/icon/app_icon.png` in the project root.
2. Run:

   ```powershell
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
   ```

3. Rebuild the app (`flutter clean` then `flutter run` or `flutter build`).

If you want, I can run the commands for you locally (I can't write binary images here), or you can paste the image file into the path and run the commands above.
